# Global Drivers of Research Efficiency (2023)

## Overview

An analysis of global research efficiency in AI, Environmental Science, and Medicine. We explore whether scientific success is driven solely by national wealth or specific domain drivers (e.g., digital infrastructure vs. health systems).

## How to setup
First, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Francisco772/Data-in-the-wild.git
```
**Requirements**
Install the necessary Python libraries:
```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly umap-learn scikit-learn statsmodels pycountry
```
Then, run the main notebook on VSCode.

Note: We use Git LFS (Large File Storage) because our datasets are large. Make sure you have Git LFS installed (git lfs install) before cloning, or download the full dataset manually via this zip link: [World Bank Data (WDI_CSV.zip)](https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/WDI_CSV.zip) .
